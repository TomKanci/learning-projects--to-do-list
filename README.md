# ToDo List Application

This is a simple ToDo List application built with Python and Flask.

## Purpose

This project served as a great learning experience where I was able to utilize and enhance my skills in Flask and SQL databases. It provided me with practical experience in building a web application from scratch, managing a database, and deploying the application.

This was my first project and, while I'm proud of what I accomplished, I recognize that there's always room for improvement. I've learned a lot from this experience and I'm confident that I can develop even better projects in the future.
